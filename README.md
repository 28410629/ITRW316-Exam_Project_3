# ITRW316-Exam_Project_3

Write a web system (.NET, PHP, Node, etc) that retrieves the total amount of memory on the server.  Ask the user for the amount of memory to reserve for the operating system and how large the page frames should be.  Calculate how many page frames will fit.  Simulate paging by randomly adding unique page numbers into frames (page x can not be in two different frames).  Ask the user for a page to search for, and show if the page is in memory, or if it causes a page fault.  Use a page replacement algorithm to load the page not found, into a frame.  Deploy the solution on :

    Windows VM with IIS (.NET system)
    OR
    Linux VM with AMP/MEAN (PHP/Node system)

Write a report on the project, give background on virtual memory, as well as the development you did on the system.  (2 to 4 pages).  Don't submit anything here.  All exam reports will be submitted as one report on eFundi under "Eksamen verslag / Exam report".  Work in groups of 2 or 3.  Code MUST be on git!  (Private repository)
